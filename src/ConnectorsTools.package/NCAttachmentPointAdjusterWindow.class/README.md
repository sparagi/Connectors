This is a tool that allows you to adjust the attachment points of a dropped Morph.

There are two buttons: one turns the grid on or off, and the other selects between movable and non-movable attachment points. The difference is that if a Connector with not attachment preference is attached to a Morph with non-movable attachment points, the attachment will remain stuck to that position.

This is appropriate for (for instance) schematic drawings.
